**pycaus** is a python package for causal survival analysis and counterfactual classaification predection with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), built on the [torchtuples](https://github.com/havakv/torchtuples) package for training PyTorch models. 

**Note:** *This package is still in its early stages of development..* 

The package contains implementations of ..
# Get Started

To get started you first need to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
You can then install **pycox** via pip: 
```sh
pip install pycaus
```




# SurvCaus
# ClassCaus


# Simulated Datasets

```python
```



# Installation



The package only works for python 3.6+.

```sh
```
